## Data types
Before we start playing around with data, it is important that you are familiar with the following basics.

There are four common data types in R, they are **numeric**, **logical**, **character** and **date**. All these data types can be used to create vectors natively.

    x <- c(1,3,2,10,5) #create a numeric vector x
    x <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE) #create a logical vector x
    x <- c("sds","sd","as") # create a character vector
    x <- as.Date(c("2019-02-25", "2019-02-27")) # create a date vector
    x[2] - x[1] # days until the homework is due 

Remember **#** is the comment character. The comments give details about the operations in case they are not clear.

## Computations in R
R can be used as an ordinary calculator. Here are some examples.  

    2 + 3 * 5     # Note the order of operations.
    3-7           # value of 3-7
    3/2           # Division
    abs(3-7)      # Absolute value of 3-7
    log(100)      # Natural logarithm with base e
    log10(100)    # logarithm with base 10
    5^2           # 5 raised to the second power
    sqrt(16)      # Square root
    exp(2)        # exponential function
    # This is a comment line

## Data structures
- R has multiple data structures. 
- If you are familiar with excel you can think of data structures as building blocks of a table and the table itself, and a table is similar to a sheet in excel. 
- Most of the time you will deal with tabular data sets, you will manipulate them, take sub-sections of them. 
- It is essential to know what are the common data structures in R and how they can be used. 
- R deals with named data structures, this means you can give names to data structures and manipulate or operate on them using those names.

## Vectors
- Vectors are one the core R data structures. 
- It is basically a list of elements of the same type (numeric,character or logical). 
- Later you will see that every column of a table will be represented as a vector. 
- R handles vectors easily and intuitively. 
- The operations on vectors will propagate to all the elements of the vectors.

## 
    x <- c(1,3,2,10,5) #create a vector named x with 5 components
                       # `c` is for combine
                       # you could use '=' but I don't recommend it.
    y <- 1:5           #create a vector of consecutive integers y
    y + 2              #scalar addition
    2*y                #scalar multiplication
    y^2                #raise each component to the second power
    2^y                #raise 2 to the first through fifth power
    y                  #y itself has not been unchanged
    y <- y*2           #here, y is changed

## Matrices
- A __matrix__ refers to a numeric array of rows and columns. 
- You can think of it as a stacked version of vectors where each row or column is a vector. 

##
One of the easiest ways to create a matrix is to combine vectors of equal length using `cbind()`, meaning 'column bind'.

    x <- c(1,2,3,4)      
    y <- c(4,5,6,7)
    m1 <- cbind(x,y)     # `cbind` is for column-bind
    m2 <- rbind(x,y)     # `rbind` is for row-bind
    t(m1)                # transpose of m1
    dim(m1)              # 2 by 5 matrix

You can also creat a matrix by listing the elements using `matrix()`:

    m2 <- matrix(c(1,3,2,5,-1,2,2,3,9),nrow=3)

## Data Frames
- A data frame is more general than a matrix, in that different columns can have different modes (numeric, character, factor, etc.). 
- A data frame can be constructed by data.frame() function. 
- For example, we illustrate how to construct a data frame from genomic intervals or coordinates.

    chr <- c("chr1", "chr1", "chr2", "chr2")
    strand <- c("-", "-", "+", "+")
    start <- c(200,4000,100,400)
    end <-c(250,410,200,450)
    mydata <- data.frame(chr, start, end, strand)
    names(mydata)
    names(mydata) <- c("A", "B", "C", "D") #change column names
    mydata 

## 
- Here you can assign names  (in caps in this example) to each list that will be combined to make a dataframe. 
- These list names will be transferred to the column name.

    mydata <- data.frame(CHROM=chr,
                     START=start,
                     STOP=end,
                     STRAND=strand)
    mydata


## Tibbles

- A __tibble__, or `tbl_df`, is a modern reimagining of the data.frame, keeping what time has proven to be effective, and throwing out what is not. 
- Tibbles are data.frames that are lazy and surly: they do less (i.e. they don't change variable names or types, and don't do partial matching) and complain more (e.g. when a variable does not exist). 
- This forces you to confront problems earlier, typically leading to cleaner, more expressive code. Tibbles also have an enhanced `print()` method which makes them easier to use with large datasets containing complex objects.

If you are new to tibbles, the best place to start is the [tibbles chapter](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tibbles.html) in *R for data science*.

##

Create a tibble from an existing object with `as_tibble()`:

    library(tibble)
    as_tibble(iris)

This will work for reasonable inputs that are already data.frames, lists, matrices, or tables.

    tibble(mydata)

## Why use a tibble over a dataframe?

- `tibble()` does much less than `data.frame()`: 
    - it never changes the type of the inputs (e.g. it never converts strings to factors!)
    - it never changes the names of variables
    - it only recycles inputs of length 1, and it never creates `row.names()`

You can read more about these features in the vignette, `vignette("tibble")`.

## Subsetting tabular data

- __Matrices__, __data frames__, and __tibbles__ are all tabular data structures. 
- You can subset them using **[ ]** and providing desired rows and columns to subset. Here is how that works conceptually:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width= "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/slicingDataFrames.png", dpi = 300)
```
