## Learning objectives for this course
> The primary learning objectives are to work towards being able to:  

* Retrieve and import genomic data.  
* Prepare data for analysis (“tidy”-ing).  
* Conduct basic exploratory analysis - getting familiar with your dataset.  
* Test specific hypotheses using computational methods.  
* Visualize and communicate your results.  
* Practice reproducible analysis.  

## Today's class outline

- Coding best practices
- Review data types
- In-class exercise on RNAseq dataset
    + Import
    + Explore
    + Tidy
    + Export
- Homework instructions

## Class rules {.build .bigger}

- Ask for help (use the stickie notes)  

- Offer help!   
      + We have a wide range of R experience in this class room  
      + Pair with someone with a different R expertise and help each other  

- Use Google *liberally*  (& the cheatsheets!)

## Coding best practices

## Data types and structures {.smaller}
- Basic data types: numeric, character, date, and logical. 
- Basic data structures: vector, matrix, array, data frame (or, tibble), and list. 

```{r, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/data-structures.png", dpi=300)
```

- Data can be queried to understand it better: `class()`, `str()`, etc. 

## Import, explore, modify, and export an RNA-seq count dataset {.smaller}

- Data sets
    + RNAseq count data (Dyle *et al*; unpublished; please keep confidential)
    + Experimental metadata

<br/>

- Our goal is to import these data, explore the data, clean up by eliminating unnecessary columns and renaming variables using base R, tidy the data, and then export the file.
