## Home work

The goal of this homework is to use the output of today's class ("count_summary_rna_mod") as a starting point to generate gene-level count data. 
 
Please execute the following tasks, knit the resulting .Rmd (Lastname_class1-homework.Rmd) and submit the .html output as your assignment.  

1. Read in the `count_summary_rna_mod.csv` we saved in class1-d. (Files: 1-class1 > data > output > count_summary_rna_mod.csv)
2. Read in the `id-mapping.csv` file provided (Files: 1-class1 > data > input > id-mapping.csv)
3. `separate` the `ensembl_transcript_id` column by the separator `.`
4. `join` the new `count_summary_rna_mod.csv` with `id-mapping.csv` 

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width= "300px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/join-for-homework.png", dpi = 300)
```

5. `glimpse` the resulting new data frame
6. Export this file as `data_transcript-level.csv` and save within data > output (we will use this as the starting point for next class)
7. Knit the resulting document and upload the resulting .html as your assignment.
